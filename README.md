# Facebook Group Auto-Moderation

This workflow automatically monitors Facebook Group posts, analyzes them using AI, detects policy violations, logs incidents, notifies moderators and automatically hides high-severity posts to keep the community clean and safe.

This workflow listens to new Facebook Group posts in real time, processes each post individually and sends the post content to AI for moderation. If a post violates group rules (spam, scam, hate, adult content or aggressive promotion), the workflow alerts moderators, stores the violation in Airtable and automatically hides the post if the severity is high.

You receive:

- **Real-time AI moderation of Facebook Group posts**
- **Automatic hiding of high-risk content**
- **Slack alerts for moderation actions**
- **Airtable logging for audit and tracking**

Ideal for Facebook Group admins who want fast, consistent and automated moderation without manual review of every post.

### Quick Start – Implementation Steps

1. Connect the **Facebook Group Webhook** to your n8n instance.
2. Add your **Facebook Page Access Token** as an environment variable.
3. Connect **OpenAI** credentials for content moderation.
4. Configure **Slack** for alerts and **Airtable** for logging.
5. Test using sample Facebook post data.
6. Activate the workflow.

## What It Does

This workflow automates Facebook Group moderation:

1. Receives new group posts via webhook.
2. Splits and processes posts one by one.
3. Normalizes post data (ID, message, user, time).
4. Sends post content to AI for moderation analysis.
5. Determines:
   - Violation or not
   - Category (spam, scam, hate, adult, etc.)
   - Severity (low / medium / high)
6. Logs violations into Airtable.
7. Sends alerts to Slack.
8. Automatically hides posts marked as **high severity**.
9. Notifies the team whether auto-hide succeeded or failed.

## Who’s It For

This workflow is ideal for:

- Facebook Group admins & moderators
- Community management teams
- Social media operations teams
- Platforms handling large group volumes
- Anyone needing automated moderation at scale
